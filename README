Perl Ferment - Yet Another tool to manage perl installs in your home directory.

Perl Ferment builds perls into $HOME/perlferment/perls/ and symlinks them to $HOME/local_perl

One of big advantage of Perl Ferment is that it lets you have multiple Perls with different CPAN libraries without the need to use local_lib.

-----

Perl Ferment comes with 3 tools:


* buildperl : Build a specific version of perl $HOME/perlferment/perls/

Usage: buildperl -version perl-5.12.1 -target clean_5_12_1

The specified version of perl must be present in $HOME/perlferment/build/ - In the future, Perl Ferment will fetch from perl.org


* listperls :

Usage: listperls

Shows the current perl installs in $HOME/perlferment/build/ and which one is in use at the moment.


* switchperl :

Usage: switchperl target_name

Switches the symlink ($HOME/local_perl) to point at the specified version in $HOME/perlferment/perls/
